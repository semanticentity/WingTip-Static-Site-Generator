# WingTip Changelog

## [v0.2.0]

### âœ¨ Features
- Added support for custom 404 pages: Users can create a `404.md` in the project root, which will be converted to `docs/site/404.html` and included in the sitemap.

### ðŸ›  Fixes & Improvements
- Corrected path handling in `main.py` and `serve.py` to ensure proper functionality when WingTip is used as a nested module (e.g., running `python wingtip/main.py` from a parent project directory).
- Refined `killDocs.sh` script:
    - Now attempts a graceful process termination (SIGTERM) before resorting to a forceful one (SIGKILL).
    - Removed obsolete PID file handling logic.
- Removed an unused internal function (`write_docs_index`) from `main.py`.
- Removed a duplicate inclusion of `clipboard.js` in `template.html`.

### ðŸ“š Documentation
- Updated `README.md` to accurately reflect nested project structure usage (e.g., `wingtip/main.py` for commands and file paths).
- Clarified `syntax.css` (generated) vs. `pygments.css` (manual reference) in `README.md`.
- Corrected the GitHub Actions workflow example in `README.md` to use `python wingtip/main.py`.
- Added `uv` pip install instructions as an alternative in `README.md`.
- Documented the new custom 404 page feature in `README.md`.
- Documented how to stop the development server (Ctrl+C) and the purpose/usage of `killDocs.sh` in `README.md`.
- Corrected `main.py` help text for sitemap generation and removed outdated notes.
- Removed mention of a non-implemented "TOC keyboard shortcut (`Alt+D`)" from this changelog (v0.1.0 entry).
