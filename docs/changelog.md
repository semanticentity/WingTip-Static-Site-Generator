- Added `uv` pip install instructions as an alternative in `README.md`.
- Documented the new custom 404 page feature in `README.md`.
- Documented how to stop the development server (Ctrl+C) and the purpose/usage of `killDocs.sh` in `README.md`.
- Corrected `main.py` help text for sitemap generation and removed outdated notes.
- Removed mention of a non-implemented "TOC keyboard shortcut (`Alt+D`)" from this changelog (v0.1.0 entry).
